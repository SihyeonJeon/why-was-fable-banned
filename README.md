The agent can't edit code until it writes `.forge/spec.json` and a deterministic
gate accepts it: restated goal, non-goals, context chosen by authority, ≥2 rejected
alternatives with the boundary each breaks, risks, and runnable acceptance. One
shared gate, installed as hooks. Works in **Claude Code** and **Codex**.

```text
$ <agent edits src/app.py>
fable-forge: implementation blocked — SPEC gate not satisfied.
  - restated_goal is empty — restate intent as 'achieve X without Y, scoped to Z'.
  - non_goals is empty — fence the over-broad version you are NOT doing.
  - need >=2 rejected_alternatives, each with the boundary it violates.
  - acceptance_criteria needs a runnable command (not prose).
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Honest scope.** It enforces that a spec exists and passes before edits land — and
> that unspeced or forbidden-path work never reaches your repo. It does **not** make
> the model smarter (benchmarked — no capability lift). The value is discipline, an
> auditable decision record per change, and safety.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SihyeonJeon/why-was-fable-banned
cd why-was-fable-banned && sh install.sh
```

`python3` only, stdlib. Disable per project: `touch .forge/OFF`. Bypass once:
`FORGE_BYPASS=1`. Remove: `sh install.sh --uninstall`.

## How it works

- **Block** — a `PreToolUse` hook intercepts every edit and exits 2 until the spec passes
- **Spec** — restated goal · non-goals · context by authority · ≥2 rejected alternatives · risks · runnable acceptance · forbidden paths
- **Verify** — "done" isn't done until each acceptance command shows live output (fail closed)
- **Apply** — on headless Codex the worker runs in a throwaway git worktree; only a gate-passing diff reaches your repo

## Quickstart

1. `sh install.sh` — wires the hooks at user level (every project + subagent inherits it)
2. Prompt your agent to do real work — a gated task auto-starts
3. The agent writes `.forge/spec.json` (it's told exactly what to fill); edits stay blocked until it passes
4. It implements, runs the acceptance commands, records evidence, then closes

Grade auto-scales the depth: typos pay almost nothing, auth/payments/migration pay
the full gate.

## Supported agents

- **Claude Code** — native hooks, in-session block (the spec adds to one pass)
- **Codex** — `forge-codex-accept "<goal>" --repo <dir>` (worktree-accept; headless)

## Where the rules came from

Recorded real engineering sessions with hooks (42 traces), extracted them as a
structured decision schema, generalized 19 into 8 decision axes, and cross-checked
the generalization with a second model. Observable artifacts only — no
chain-of-thought, local, secrets masked.

<summary>Three layers, increasing cost and depth</summary>

| layer | checks | how |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gates/forge_gate.py` | **form** — fields, real paths, forbidden, fail-closed | deterministic, free |
| `gates/forge_judge.py` | **meaning** — 0–2 rubric, gaming detection | optional LLM judge |
| `bench/` | **correctness** — hidden grader | runs the tests |
