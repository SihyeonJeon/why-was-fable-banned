"""PostToolUse: record which files an edit touched, so the done gate can VERIFY
the implementation did not conflict with the architecture/policy the spec declared
(forbidden_paths) — not just that the spec declared them.

Append-only, deduped, hook-side (zero model tokens). Records only while a task is
active. Never blocks (observational). Runtime-agnostic (Claude Code + Codex)."""
