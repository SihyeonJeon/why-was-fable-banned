"""fable-forge gate engine — self-contained, stdlib only, model-agnostic.

Enforces the SPEC -> IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY procedure by validating a lightweight
spec artifact (`.forge/spec.json`) under the project root. Runtime adapters
(Claude Code hooks, Codex execpolicy/wrapper) call this and block on a non-zero
exit. No dependency on fable-pack; nothing networked; secrets never read.

Subcommands:
  scaffold  --root R --goal G [--grade L]   create .forge/, ACTIVE marker, spec skeleton
  validate  --root R --gate spec|done       exit 0 pass / 1 fail; prints failures
  active    --root R                         exit 0 if a task is active, else 1
  status    --root R                         human-readable state
  close     --root R                         clear ACTIVE (after done gate passes)
  classify  --text T                         exit 0 if prompt is work-shaped, else 1
  contract  --root R                          print the grade's full pass-conditions (inject up front)

Exit codes: 0 = pass/yes, 1 = fail/no, 2 = usage/internal error.
